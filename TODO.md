# TODO

- 404 page. Happy with the default?
- Oh and I need to add Take This to my CV 😛

## Pre-Launch Checks

- [ ] View all pages from phone
- [ ] View all pages with dark mode enabled
- [ ] Google Lighthouse score
- [ ] Does noise.png background remain after navigating away from CV? (like it does on localhost)

## Nice to Have

- Home
  - Media section with selected videos
- CV
  - Convert source to format compatible with Netlify CMS
- Images uploaded through Netlify CMS
  - https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/5990
- BlogPost
  - Maybe rename layout: "post" to "blogpost"
